### MSc in HPC & Big Data Bioinformatics | Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB)

Welcome! This repository houses the core development, analytical scripts, and high-resolution visual outputs generated during my **Machine Learning** project. This work was developed as part of the optative modules within the Master's program at **UAB**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

To keep the workspace organized and reproducible, the project is structured as follows:

### 📊 `figures/`
*Contains all visual results and data interpretations generated by the model.*
> [!TIP]
> These images are exported in **higher resolution** than those found in the final written report to ensure maximum clarity for data inspection and publication-quality review.

### 📜 `scripts/`
*The "engine room" of the project.*
* **`main_script.py`**: The primary Python pipeline covering data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
* **`environment.yml`**: The Conda environment specification file to ensure full reproducibility of the analytical environment.
